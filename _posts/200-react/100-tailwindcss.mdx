# Tailwind CSS and Typescript in Next.js: A Match Made in Heaven
When it comes to web development, two of the most popular technologies out there are [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). But what about combining them with the powerful framework that is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)? Well, I'm here to tell you that this combination is like a match made in heaven!

To get started with using Tailwind CSS and Typescript together within your Next app, you'll need to do a few things first:

 1) Install all necessary packages for both technologies by running `npm install` or `yarn add`. This will include tailwindcss as well as @types/tailwincss for typings support (if needed).

 2) Create your configuration files - these may be different depending on how you want your setup but generally speaking they should include tailwing's config file (called “tailwingconfig”), tsconfig file for typings support if needed; also make sure next-env has been set up properly so that it can detect environment variables correctly when building the project later on down the line - more info on setting up these files can be found at https://nextjs-docs-guidebook--maxamisawa1stedition--2020q4_2ndedition_0xj5m6hgfvz3xytbse7d9k8l2u0p1r4eo5c/.

 3) Add some code into pages/_app which initializes TailWindCSS & adds global stylesheets such as fonts etc., then import those stylesheet into components where required via React Components API's styled() method e..g .

 4) Lastly compile everything once ready by running either
npm run build or yarn build commands from root directory followed by deploying application onto production server e..

# How to Use Tailwind CSS with Typescript in Next.js
As a programmer, you know the importance of having a modern and efficient workflow for your projects.
That's why it's important to use tools like Tailwind CSS and Typescript when working with Next.js! Here is how you can get started:
## Step 1: Install Packages
First, install the necessary packages by running `npm install tailwindcss typescript @types/tailwindcss` from your terminal window or command line interface (CLI).
This will add all of the required dependencies for using Tailwind CSS with TypeScript in Next.js project!

## Step 2: Set up Your Configuration Files  		   	   	     	                                   
Next, create two configuration files that will be used by both TypeScript and TailWindCSS - `tsconfig.json` & `postcss-config`.
The contents of these files should look something like this (make sure to include any additional settings as needed):
